# Remote-Message-Passing-Communication
Remote-Message-Passing-Communication

Purpose:
This project requires you to design and implement a socket-based1 message-passing communication channel. Messages are modeled after HTTP messages containing a text header and optionally a body that may consist of binary or text data. The header contains a sequence of lines, the first of which is a command, and remaining header lines contain message attributes2, e.g., address of sender and receiver, and, if the message contains a body, a content-length attribute that specifies the number of bytes in the body. The message header is terminated with a blank line. In Project #4 you will use XML transported in the message body to describe remote processing activities and receive results.

Your communication channel is required to provide, on the receiving end, a dispatcher that posts the message to one of a collection of registered communicators. Each communicator has an input queue and a child thread that processes messages from its queue.

Requirements:
Your Message-Passing Communication project:

1. Shall use standard C++3 and the standard library, compile and link from the command line, using Visual Studio 2013, as provided in the ECS clusters and operate in the environment provided there4.
2. Shall use services of the C++ std::iostream library for all input and output to and from the userâ€™s console and C++ operator new and delete for all dynamic memory management.
3. (4) Shall use Sockets5 to implement a Message-Passing Communication facility that transports messages, as described in the Purpose section, to an endpoint specified by an ip address and port number or network name.
4. (3) Shall provide a class for constructing and interpreting messages.
5. (4) Shall support transporting binary and text files to a specified endpoint.
6. (4) Shall provide sender and receiver classes that encapsulate the communication channel facilities into easy to use packages.
7. (4) Shall demonstrate the construction of a peer-to-peer communication channel that has a sender and receiver on each end and the sending of a request and receipt of a reply on one end and the construction of the reply on the other end.
8. (1) Shall provide test executive and display packages that, combined with the communication facility, demonstrates that you meet all the requirements of this specification. It is important that your demonstration is accurate, complete, and clear. Your score for meeting requirements will be based on this display. You will get no credit for requirements met but not accurately demonstrated.
9. Shall provide one compile.bat and one run.bat file that build and then execute your demonstrations. Please package your project code, projects, solution, and batch files in a single zip archive. Please do not submit archives that are not zips.
